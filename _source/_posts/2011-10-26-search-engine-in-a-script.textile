This is a post about running "Picky":http://florianhanke.com/picky/ in a small script.

h2. Design Philosopy

You all know that with Picky we want the full flexibility of Ruby.

What we also want is a search engine that runs with a minimal setup. Small and sweet. Portable, lightweight, bam!

In short: Picky wants to be the "Sinatra":http://sinatrarb.com of search engines. Did we achieve this? Not yet, but we are very close indeed.

Let's have a quick dance in the rain.

h2. The code

Copy and run this!

<pre class="sh_ruby"><code># Possible since Picky 3.2.0.
#
require 'picky'

include Picky

Thing = Struct.new :id, :name

index = Index.new :test do
  category :name, similarity: Similarity::DoubleMetaphone.new(3)
end

index.replace Thing.new(1, 'Picky')
index.replace Thing.new(2, 'Parslet')

things = Search.new(index) do
  boost [:name] => +3
end

p things.search("Pick").ids
p things.search("Pic").to_hash
p things.search("Parsley~").allocations</code></pre>

That's it. Easy to just try something, and later evolve into a fully fleshed, super-powerful search engine.

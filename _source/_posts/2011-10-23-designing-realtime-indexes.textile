This is a post about designing realtime indexes for  "Picky":http://florianhanke.com/picky/.

Realtime indexes are an exciting thing! The possibility of inserting something into a search engine, then having the thing pop up in results is fantastic. Wouldn't you love that in Picky? Man, me too!

Too bad that I yet have to implement it. Heh.

On the other hand, some good TDD should do it. "TDD" you ask? TDD of course, is the noble activity of Thought Driven Development. Also known as QDD, Question Driven Development.

Let's fire up the cranial engines and get the gray matter bubbling.

Specifically, I'd like to talk about the API, and how to implement it in Picky. Along the way I will touch on the inverted index, necessary bookkeeping, how I will implement it, how to use it and how *not* to use it, the latter being more important than the former.

h2. What is a realtime index?

A realtime index is an index that has the ability to have e.g. text indexed at runtime, and returning results for that text *immediately* after

One example for a Ruby realtime search engine is "Whistlepig":http://todo by "William Morgan":http://twitter.com/wm.

h2. What I want

h2. The inverted index

h2. How not to implement it

(the naive approach)

h2. How to implement it

(the fast approach that needs some bookkeeping (TM))

h2. Note: Ignoring other constraints

h2. Note: TDD/QDD (Pen & Paper)

h2. Caveats

(no Unicorn, single server – crossing that bridge when I get to it)

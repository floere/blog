h2. Conclusion

So we've seen
# that reloading indexes in a running Picky server is easy
# how you use signals to reload the server
# how reloading works in different web servers
# that reloading the indexes isn't without problems
# that a Redis backend is in the works and how this would work

Hope you learnt something new!

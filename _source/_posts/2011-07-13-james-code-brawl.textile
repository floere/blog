h2. First Rule: You do not talk about Code Brawl

Mischief. Mayhem. Ruby.

You might have read all about James in the previous postâ€¦
Thanks to "Jeff Kreeftmeier":http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/,
now is your chance to show off with whatever crazy dialog you can come up with!

It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything.

Will you install an Asterisk phone system that will make you able to call James at home where he will
do various things for you, like switch lights on/off, feed the hamster, or yell at the kids?

Or will you go the way of the informative, connecting it to your local train information system,
so that James can say "Dude, you should run!" if you ask him "When does my train go"?

OR will you program some sort of voice based text adventure like "Zork":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork,
where you control the main character by the powers of your voice only?

Go here and fulfil your wildest dreams of "talking to a computer":http://codebrawl.com/contests/james-your-very-own-voice-commanded-servant.
Or here, and "enter some ideas":http://github.com/floere/james/wiki if you only feel like thinking, but not typing.

Without pain, without sacrifice, we would have nothing.

No shirts, no shoes. If this is your first night at Code Brawl, "you have to brawl":http://codebrawl.com/contests/james-your-very-own-voice-commanded-servant!

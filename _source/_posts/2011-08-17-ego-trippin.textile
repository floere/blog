During the last year, I started noticing a surge in _ego tripping_ in the Ruby community.

Discussions started to be about egos^1^, not projects, the work being done.

Some open source projects come with a big ego attached. And if a project is released that fills a niche next to that project, that ego feels threatened.

I get that a project can be like one's baby. And you may cherish it. But you are not your baby.

If you feel personally attacked by someone releasing a project similar to yours, that's a signal to lean back for a few days. Yes, your project will lose some users. But they might come back.
Despite all the early hype and enthusiasm: In the long run, people use what's good.

And what's good usually went at least through some pressure and inspiration from other projects.^1^

Conversely, I noticed that, instead of contributing to existing projects, some egos needed to have their own.

Yes, "I saw that the core method didn't work the way I wanted" etc., but did you really try and discuss it with the owner, or send a pull request?

Now, this is not about not having a voice of one's own. This is not about you wanting a bit of recognition for your hard learned skills. This is simply a call for a bit of humility and respect for the work of others. And a call to learn from what others might do better in their projects, and what you can learn from it. And also a call to try to teach and improve someone else's project.

Since in the end, giving (and receiving) the gift of knowledge and respect is one of the greatest you can give.

So try to be humble.


^1^ Picky got good pressure from Tyre. Very thankful for that.

        <div><p>Well structured code lets you minimize Information flow (because if it is where it needs to be, it doesn&#8217;t need to flow), and by accident and minimizing frictional loss also makes it fast.</p>

<p>So, always structure your code well, as it will help you remove redundancies and minimize coupling. Also it will enhance understanding not just by you, but others as well.</p>

<p>You will walk away from your code daily, feeling in control and happy.</p>

<p>P.S: With tests you can forget large parts of the application and still feel in control (in an positive sense).</p></div>

        <h1>Dipping your toe in Ruby C</h1><div><p>This is a little follow up to my presentation at EuRuKo 2010. In it, I urged people to look under Ruby&#8217;s hood, to check out the Ruby C code.</p>
<p>So if you have done that, and would like to get going coding your first extension yourself, I&#8217;ve put together some files that might be helpful.</p>

<p><script src="http://gist.github.com/422833.js"></script></p>

<p>The C code is nothing to look at (It just p-s what is given to it), but check out the Ruby C code of Ruby itself, for example in <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Array.html"><a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Array.html">http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Array.html</a></a> by clicking on the method signatures. Or looking at Ruby source code directly.</p>
<p>Have fun!</p></div>

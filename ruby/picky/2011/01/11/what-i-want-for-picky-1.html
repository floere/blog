      <h1>What I want for Picky 1 (Separation of HTTP and Multiprocessing)</h1>
      <p>Recently, I&#8217;ve been thinking about how I handle search requests in <a href="http://floere.github.com/picky/">Picky</a>.</p>
      <h2>The Situation</h2>
      <p>What goes on currently is this:
      I have a Unicorn master and Unicorn worker children.</p>
      <p>When a <span class="caps">HTTP</span> Request arrives, a child is called to unwrap the <span class="caps">HTTP</span> specific stuff, then the child&#8217;s Application#call method is called, which in turn calls a query&#8217;s #search_with_text method which takes a query string and an offset.</p>
      <p>The routing uses Joshua Peek&#8217;s <a href="http://github.com/josh/rack-mount">rack-mount</a>, which is also used in Rails 3.</p>
      <p>In Picky, you route queries like this:</p>
      <pre><code>route %r{\A/path/of/query\Z} =&gt; my_beautiful_query</code></pre>
      <p>This will route e.g. <code>localhost:8080/path/of/query?query=test</code> to the query object <code>my_beautiful_query</code>, where #search_with_text will be called with the parameters &#8220;test&#8221; and an offset of 0 (the default).</p>
      <h2>How I&#8217;d like it to be</h2>
      <p>Performance tests have shown that sometimes, a search in Picky is even faster than the <span class="caps">HTTP</span> overhead.</p>
      <p>Also, since all full searches first go through a web app (to enrich the results), it doesn&#8217;t necessarily make sense to use <span class="caps">HTTP</span> again from the web app to Picky.</p>
      <p>What I&#8217;d like to offer the Picky users is not just a <span class="caps">HTTP</span> <code>route</code> method, but also methods for <span class="caps">TCP</span>, or sockets.</p>
      <pre><code>map_tcp 3001 =&gt; my_other_beautiful_query</code></pre>
      <p>or</p>
      <pre><code>socket '/path/to/socket' =&gt; yet_another_beautiful_query</code></pre>
      <p>Note: Perhaps I use the <code>route</code> method for all of them.</p>
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>Unicorn only supports <span class="caps">HTTP</span>. That in itself would not be a problem.</p>
      <p>The problem stems from the fact that</p>
      <ol>
      	<li>the forking of worker children</li>
      	<li>the <span class="caps">HTTP</span> parsing
      are baked together, making my offering multiple interfaces impossible, or very hard.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><a href="http://unicorn.bogomips.org/">Unicorn</a> is great, btw.</p>
      <h2>So what I&#8217;d really like</h2>
      <p>I&#8217;d like to separate the <span class="caps">HTTP</span> handling and the forking of worker children.</p>
      <p>What would be best:</p>
      <ol>
      	<li>1 master process</li>
      	<li>N children with adapters for <span class="caps">HTTP</span>/<span class="caps">TCP</span>/Socket requests</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Alternatively, each child only processes the <span class="caps">HTTP</span>/<span class="caps">TCP</span>/Socket requests and then passes on (to a Unix socket) a standardized message with the query text and an offset. Another child (or the same) would then perform the standardized search request.</p>
      <p>So in short I&#8217;d like to be able to say: Start me a server with 10 children which map <span class="caps">HTTP</span> requests to that query, while full requests just use <span class="caps">TCP</span> since they come from a webserver.</p>
      <h2>Outlook</h2>
      <p>The <code>Query#search_with_text</code> interface is already defined.</p>
      <p>What I will start working on is extracting the <span class="caps">HTTP</span> parsing from (probably) Mongrel. For multiprocessing, I could use <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/procrastinate">procrastinate</a>. The thing that&#8217;s yet missing is a buffering interprocess communication, which I might write myself, or use one of Kaspar Schiess&#8217; future <span class="caps">IPC</span> gems :)</p>
      <p>So, a great future is ahead. I hope it all turns out as I&#8217;d like it.</p>
